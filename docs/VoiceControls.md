# Hands Free Voice Controls

**NOTE:** By default these voice controls are disabled as they use an as yet unknown
amount of internet.  You can turn them on in the "general" section of Settings.
 
Google Play Music Desktop Player has implemented the `webkitSpeechRecognition`
API to pick up what you say and uses a cool JS command parser that I wrote myself
to translate that into a single action or a complex series of actions.

For example you can say some as simple as:
> Hey music, pause  

This would simply pause your music

To something as complex as:
> Hey music, can you set the volume to 40%, play playlist My Tunes and then mix it up

Which would
* Set your volume to 40%
* Play one of your playlists with the name "My Tunes"
* Turn shuffle on play a random song from your current queue

This voice controls are as powerful as we make them, if you want a new voice
command you can try implement it yourself or raise a feature request issue.

## What can I say though?

All command listed below must be prefixed with a hotword.  Our current hotword's
are `Hey music` and `OK player`.

You commands don't have to sound robotic either, you can use basic grammar between commands such as *'can you'*.  So instead of *Hey music pause* it becomes nicer and *Hey music, can you pause*.
